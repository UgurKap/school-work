There are a lot of different things I like, but I chose to talk about cats since
I miss my feline friends in Mersin. I got some new friends in Istanbul as well, but
it is a lot different when you actually cared for them since they were babies.

Other than cats, I obviously like technology. And I like programming. What intrigued
me in programming was power of creating. I really like to create different things
and I want to do something good for the world. Computer engineering made a lot of sense
after I consider these.

I like video games as well. When I was a lot younger(10-11), I dreamt of the days
I created video games. To reach this goal, I had to study computer engineering. Now, the end goal is different but means to reach my goal is same. I am studying computer engineering in one of the best schools in Turkey.

I like reading books. The genres I like reading are comic books, science fiction, cyberpunk, science books etc.

I used to train for boxing. It is another hobby of mine. It was so fun until you get punched.

I will add more information to the index.html page as the steps progress. Information is not in a complete state. I have a lot of memories about cats.
