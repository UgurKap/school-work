        <h2 id="z">Zeytin</h2>
        <p>Zeytin was my first cat beginning to our adventures with our cats. She was probably left by her mother and she was really tiny and sick. And luckily, she was sleeping somewhere near our home. Since I was a child, I wanted a cat or dog. But my mother was afraid cats and it was a impossible dream. That changed 3 years ago when my mother saw her.</p><p>We prepared home for her, took care of her, took her to the vet and were happy. She was one of the cutest cats you could ever see. But she was kind of aggressive and I am pretty sure 20% of my scars are from her. Unfortunately, when she was playing in the garden, someone thought she was cute and decided to stole her.</p>

        <h2 id="k">Kömür</h2>
        <p>Kömür was one of the most different cats you could ever see. He was a really athletic, charismatic, smart and powerful cat. And he really liked people, too. If we would go on a family trip, after we return he would greet us crying. If I was going to bakery, he would follow me.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately, he was stolen from as well. Thief just &quot;<span style="font-style: italic;">didn't see</span>&quot; his name and address in his ID'd tag.</p>

        <div class="mycat">
        <img class="left" src="images/Lily.jpg" alt="A picture of Lily" title="Cat"/>
        <h2 id="lil">Lily</h2>
        <p>Lily was Kömür's brother. After we started to took care of Kömür, we saw this little dude following some girls. It was clear girls didn't want him but we did and we took him. Kömür and Lily were really good friends. But in time of a fight, Lily would just go behind the Kömür and hide. </p>
        
        <p>After Kömür was stolen, he was depressed. A month later, he ran away.</p>

        <div class="mycat">
        <img class="right" src="images/Lucy.jpg" alt="Picture of Lucy" title="Cat"/>
        <h2 id="lu">Lucy</h2>
        <p>Lucy was at most 2 months old when he came. He was able to see Kömür and Lily. It is funny he came to our place. Since we feed the cats of our neighbourhood, there was a large cat population in our garden. And there was always food so no cat was going hungry. If a cat couldn't find anything else, s/he knew there was always our garden :&#41;</p>
        <p>One day, I saw this little cat following her mother. Mother came to our garden and waited a bit. After Lucy got distracted, she just ran away and left him here. Of course, we fed him. Next morning, he was gone. One day later, Lucy and her mother came to our garden again. And same thing happened! Next day, he disappeared again. Mother was successful on her 3rd try and he stayed with us.</p>
        <p>He was really afraid of humans but slowly, I made him get used to us. Now he allows us to pet him when he wants it. And if he doesn't want it, he quietly growls so we understand that it is not the time. Probably 60% of my scars are from Lucy.</p>

        <img class="left" src="images/Titrek.jpg" alt="A picture of Titrek" title="Cat"/>
        <h2 id="t">Titrek</h2>
        <p>Titrek is little brother of Lucy. When I first saw him, he was following another group. Clearly, those other cats weren't his siblings because he was younger than them and they were always beating him up.</p>
        <p>One day, he and his group came to our garden and of course I didn't miss the chance to pet him. First, he was little afraid but after a while he got used to it. He used to it so bad, he came to our doorstep couple times a day for us to pet him. And he wouldn't stop crying if we didn't pet him. Hence the name Titrek, because he was always crying and shaking.</p>
